# InvisiFraud- Fraud Intelligence System

Modern financial systems face a significant problem in detecting fraud, as the use of credit cards 
and internet payments increases the likelihood of fraudulent behavior. Machine learning (ML) 
and deep learning (DL) are crucial techniques for more dynamic detection because traditional 
rule-based systems find it difficult to keep up with changing fraud strategies.  
The InvisiFraud system uses CNN-based deep learning models and supervised machine learning 
to accurately detect fraudulent transactions. The system investigates undersampling (lowering the 
majority class) and oversampling (raising the minority class) in order to address the problem of 
class imbalance, where fraudulent transactions are substantially fewer than valid ones. In terms 
of recall, precision, and F1-score, oversampling regularly performs better than undersampling.  
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess machine learning models, such as 
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. The 
CNN improves the ability to identify intricate fraud patterns. In order to optimize fraud 
detection, balance precision and recall, and suggest future enhancements, this study examines the 
methodology, results, and limitations of InvisiFraud. The system shows how resampling, strong 
machine learning models, and suitable metrics may greatly improve the precision and 
effectiveness of fraud detection in practical financial applications.
